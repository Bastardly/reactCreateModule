# React CreateModule (POC)
This is created to speed up development by making a uniform starting modules. 

To use this, you can either compile the repo yourself, or you can download the executables.

'createModule' file for Mac, and 'createModule.exe' file for windows.

You then run it from the console.

./createmodule YourModuleName

CreateModule will place the new module relative to the placement of the executable at ./modules/yourmodulename

## Disclaimer
This is a proof of concept. I might decide to make this more customizable. 
But for now, it was just an excuse to use Go.

Go is awesome...
